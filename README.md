## Content
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to store all notebooks utilized for the final capstone project. This readme file outlines the main object of each notebook stored within this repository and is broken down into the deliverables sectioned out by the course. 

## Deliverable 1
- No content

## Deliverable 2 
- To be updated

## Deliverable 3
### 1. CIND 820 - Project Version 2.1 - Data Preperation Section
- The main purpose of this notebook is to clean the sampled dataset from the Yelp Reviews dataset.
- The key data cleaning steps performed include: Correcting datatypes, cleans and preprocesses the 'text' data-column, balancing the distribution of star-ratings, and feature engineering sentiment-scores and a Bag-of-Words matrix.
- The final output of this notebook is a cleaned dataset that is analysis and model training ready. This cleaned dataset is saved as a separate .csv file for the *Data Analysis Section* which will be in a separate .ipynb notebook.

### 2. CIND 820 - Project Version 2.1 - Data Analysis Section
- This notebook aims to analyze and assess trends and patterns observed within the cleaned dataset.
- It deploys descriptive statistics on the overall cleaned dataset to get a gauge of the overall distribution and central tendencies of the dataset as a whole
- Then for the exploratory data analysis portion, it further disects the distributions using boxplots and histograms but at a grouped star-rating level. This helped reveal patterns unique to each star-rating group
- The notebook includes various visualizations for ease of interpretation.
